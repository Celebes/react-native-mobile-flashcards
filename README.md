This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Generic version of setup guide is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

I recommend using **yarn** instead of **npm**.

## App info

This is the final project of **Udacity's React Nanodegree** course.

It was completed using **React Native** and **Redux**

It is a simple [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) clone, basically flashcards for learning purposes:
* You can view all your decks of cards in scrollable list view
* You can create new decks of cards with custom names
* You can add new cards to decks, each card is a quesion and answer tuple
* You can take quizes on a specific deck and receive a score once you're done
* You will receive a notification at 8 PM if you forget to take at least 1 quiz that day
* Everything is persisted on your phone
